/*
I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays... Actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.
*/
function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
  let sum = 0;
  let arr = [];
  
  for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
    sum = arr1[i] + arr2[i];
    arr.push(sum);
  }
  
  return arr.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current, 0);
}
